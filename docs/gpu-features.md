# GPU image features

TypeCV includes an experimental single-scale feature frontend implemented with
TypeShade compute kernels. `extractFeaturesGpu` converts RGBA pixels to
grayscale, scores FAST-9 corners, keeps up to four high-scoring candidates in
each 24 × 24 tile, estimates orientation from the intensity centroid, and
computes a deterministic 256-bit rotated BRIEF descriptor. `matchFeaturesGpu`
calculates Hamming distances with `countOneBits`, applies a nearest/second
nearest ratio in both directions, and returns mutual matches.
Extraction supports frames from 48 × 48 through the active device's storage and
dispatch limits, with a maximum of 2,000 selected features per frame. Matching
rejects inputs above four million pairwise descriptor comparisons to bound GPU
work.

```ts
import { ShadeDevice, extractFeaturesGpu, matchFeaturesGpu } from 'typecv/gpu';

const device = await ShadeDevice.open({ backend: 'webgpu' });
try {
  const first = await extractFeaturesGpu(device, firstRgba, width, height);
  const second = await extractFeaturesGpu(device, secondRgba, width, height);
  const correspondences = await matchFeaturesGpu(device, first, second);
  // correspondences.matches is [firstFeature, secondFeature, ...].
} finally {
  await device.dispose();
}
```

The matcher returns final feature indices and Hamming distances to the host;
frame decoding, RGBA packing, camera graph control, and current mapper inputs
are host work. The pixel tests and descriptor math run on the selected
TypeShade tier. The browser video lab explicitly requests WebGPU and does not
retry on CPU. The existing incremental mapper then runs GPU geometric
verification, PnP, triangulation, filtering and bundle adjustment.

This is an initial CV operator, not a COLMAP-equivalent feature frontend. It is
single-scale, does not model lens distortion, and has not been benchmarked on
physical GPUs. Textureless scenes, repeated patterns, rolling shutter, motion
blur, weak parallax, inaccurate focal assumptions, or very long video can
produce too few matches, unregistered frames, or misleading scale. Inspect the
reported reprojection error, camera path, unregistered views, and source video;
the sparse viewer is not a dense surface reconstruction.
